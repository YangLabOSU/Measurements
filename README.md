# Installation
### Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed. 
Later Python versions do not work with the pythonnet version we need to interface with the PPMS. You can check the Python version you have in the command line with:
```
python --version
```
If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to do, for example:
```
python37 --version
```
For further steps in the installation, always make sure to use Python 3.7.
